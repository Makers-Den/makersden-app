# ui package

The `ui` package contains UI components and screens for both `web` and `native` apps. Most code of the `ui` package is shared between platforms. Sometimes there are some differences. Components used only by the `web` app should be stored in directories named `web` - `/components/web/ImageGallery`.
The same rules apply to the components used only by the `native` app - `/components/native/ImageGallery`. Other than that there are no strict rules,
be pragmatic and try to follow the style the existing codebase.
