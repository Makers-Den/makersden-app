# Generate estimation based on Google Sheet data

#### 1. Create an estimation sheet

Each estimation starts with the estimation sheet. You can create your estimation sheet from the [Template Estimation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-LS9Nz0pVSRI-SzNmAYGasjlWFmbHxM5Z7gAg0bjulI/edit#gid=0). If you're added to the [Makers' Den App shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AMa-Ta1Xov41Uk9PVA), then you can simply use `from template` option in order to create the estimation. Otherwise you will have to copy the content of the [Template Estimation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-LS9Nz0pVSRI-SzNmAYGasjlWFmbHxM5Z7gAg0bjulI/edit#gid=0) and paste it to your sheet.

#### 2. Fill the sheet with the data

Sheets must follow strict format requirements, in order to be easily parsed by our backend. If we had to create an ecommerce website for the company selling guitars, this is how the estimation could look like
